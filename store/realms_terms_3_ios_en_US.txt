You can manage the Realms Plus subscription and turn off auto-renewal by accessing your iTunes Account settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that takes you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you wonâ€™t be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.
